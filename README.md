## 🧾 Key Highlights

- **Feature Engineering**: Performed extensive preprocessing and engineered meaningful features from banking dataset  
- **Modeling Approach**: Applied multiple ML algorithms including:  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Neural Network  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used `GridSearchCV` to optimize model parameters across algorithms  
- **Performance**:  
  - Achieved **91.5% accuracy** overall  
  - Attained an **F1-score of 0.60 on the minority class** using the best Decision Tree model  
- **Business Impact**:  
  - Enabled targeted lead prioritization  
  - Reduced outreach inefficiencies  
  - Boosted conversion rates
